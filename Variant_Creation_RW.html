        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>Introduction</b>
          </font>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Variants are games
          based on Diplomacy with different maps or slightly modified rules or
          both. Realpolitik has the capability of running variants. Many variants
          are already included with the package, but Realpolitik also has a "plug-in"
          scheme that allows anyone to add new variants. If you know of a map
          variant that you want to run on Realpolitik, you can probably do it.
          It's not that hard.</font>
          <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><br>
          &nbsp; </font>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>Variant Creation</b>
          </font>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">You make your own
          variant by creating the necessary files and placing them in the correct
          sub-folder. Most of these files are text files or common graphic file
          formats. One file is created by the Region Tool which is an application
          that's included with the Realpolitik package. This manual describes
          the individual elements you need to create a variant. However, you don't
          necessarily need to create these elements from scratch. If your variant
          is based on a map that already exists for another variant or the standard
          game, it's a real snap to make it. In many cases you will only need
          to copy the folder (including its contents) of a variant that already
          exists, then change the name of the folder to the new variant and make
          minor changes to some of the support files within that folder.</font>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Inside the Realpolitik
          folder there is a folder called "Variant Files", inside of which there
          is a folder for each Realpolitik variant. In each of the variant folders
          there is a group of files that Realpolitik needs to run that variant
          &#150 even the standard Diplomacy game has a set of these files inside the
          "Standard" folder. Some variants make use of the files in another variant's
          folder. So it is very important that you do not change the names of
          the "Variant Files" folder, or the names of any of the variant folders
          inside it, or the names of any of the files inside the variant folders.
          It is also important that you not move these files or sub-folders to
          different locations. If you do these things some of the variants may
          stop working, including the standard game.</font> <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><br>
          &nbsp; </font>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>The Variant Folder</b>
          </font>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#000000" size="2">As
          mentioned, the folder for a particular variant resides inside the "Variant
          Files" folder. We'll use the name "Variant" as the example throughout
          this manual. The name of a variant's folder can be named anything you
          like, but for clarity the variant folder is usually named the same name
          as the variant itself. Changing the names of variant folders could adversely
          affect other variants that share files.</font>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The following is
          a description of each type of file in the variant folder and the files'
          contents. With one exception, each of these files needs to be edited
          by you the variant creator, unless the exact file needed already exists
          (from another variant already made). Use the previously existing Standard
          files as an example to help you figure things out. And be sure to use
          the correct naming conventions as shown in the following.</font>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Note that for all
          the text files, any line starting with # is a comment and is ignored.
          The comments in the release variants are there for clarity, but you
          can put any notes you want after a #. Also, tabs and extra spaces are
          ignored.</font> <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><br>
          &nbsp; </font>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>Variant.cnt</b>

          can move.
          This is the hardest file for the variant creator to make - actually
          it's not hard - it's tedious. But if your variant is based on a map
          that's already used by another variant, then you're home free. This
          file follows a very structured syntax. It is the same format used by
          the Diplomacy judges (servers used to run games over the internet automatically).
          So if you download a judge .map file, you should be able to plug it

          <b>Making the Variant.var File Work With Shared Files</b> </font>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">As you can see,
          the information on most of the lines of the Variant.var file is generally
          the name of another file which RealWorld uses to run the variant.
          Assuming that the referenced file is in the same variant folder as the
          Variant.var file nothing more is needed. But the Variant.var file can
          also reference files that are in other folders and are used by different
          variants (and therefore have different names).</font>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">For example, the
          variant "1898" uses the same map as the standard game, but each country
          starts with only one unit. The only files that are different than the
          standard game are the 1898.var, the 1898.gam and the 1898.txt files.
          The 1898.var file must be located in the 1898 folder. All the other
          files could be located in any other folder. But in the case of the 1898.gam
          and 1898.txt files, it doesn't really make sense to place it anywhere
          other than the 1898 folder.</font>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">So if you were creating
          1898 from scratch, the first approach you could use is to make copies
          of all the files from the Standard folder, place them in the 1898 folder,
          and change all their names from "Standard.xxx" to "1898.xxx". Then you
          would open the 1898.var file (which used to be the Standard.var file)
          and replace every occurrence of "Standard" with "1898". You would then
          open the 1898.gam file (which used to be the Standard.gam file) and
          edit it appropriately, and the same for the 1898.txt file.</font>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Or you could use
          another approach. Rather than copying all those "Standard" files to
          the 1898 folder, you could use the 1898.var file to refer to the needed
          files in their locations in the Standard folder. For example, the MapData
          line in the 1898.var file would read:</font>
        <blockquote><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">MapData:
          Standard/Standard.map</font></blockquote>
        <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The "Standard" before
        the slash is telling RealWorld to look in the Standard folder. The "Standard.map"
        after the slash is telling Realpolitik what file to use. But even using
        this approach, the 1898.var file still needs to be in the 1898 folder,
        and 1898.gam and 1898.txt files might as well be in the 1898 folder.</font>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Sharing files is
          generally a good idea. First of all, if there is an error in a file,
          such as a Variant.map file which is used by many variants, it can be
          fixed in one place. Secondly, it saves space.</font> <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><br>

          </font>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The Region Tool
          is a program included with Realpolitik that you use to create the Variant.rgn
          file, which is used by RealWorld to know where you are when you click
          on the map. To use this, you need a Variant.map file, a Variant.pct/Variant.bmp
          file and a Variant-Borders.pct/Variant-Borders.bmp file and they all
          need to be located in the same folder.</font>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The Variant-Borders.pct/bmp
          file will be used in the background to show the Region Tool where the
          borders are for each space, and the Variant.pct/bmp file will be used
          to show you what the map will look like in RealWorld as you work.
          The Variant-Borders.pct/bmp file has to be an exact replica of the Variant.pct/bmp
          file but with all the color and extra stuff removed. In other words,
          the Variant-Borders.pct/bmp file should show nothing but the borders
          and these borders have to line up exactly with the borders of the Variant.pct/bmp
          file. You also need to make sure there are no gaps in your borders or
          the Region Tool will treat two spaces connected by a gap, as one space.
          Be sure that the spaces in the Variant-Borders.pct/bmp file have a white
          background or fill. If you use "no fill" as opposed to a white fill,
          The Region Tool will not be able to scan the spaces. If you have bi-coastal
          spaces, you will need to draw a line down the middle of the space in
          the Variant-Borders.pct/bmp file to represent the split between the
          two coastal areas for fleet placement. The Region Tool will automatically
          join the two coastal areas to create the entire space. Note that the
          line between the two coastal areas must be only one pixel wide for this
          to work properly. The Region Tool can currently not deal with tricoastal regions.
          These have to be constructed by hand.</font>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">When you open the
          Region Tool, you will get the "open file" dialog box. Find and open
          the Variant.map file. The two graphic files will be opened by the Region
          Tool automatically assuming they are in their correct location which
          is in the same folder as the Variant.map file.</font>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In the lower left-hand
          corner of the window, it will ask you to click on a space. Click anywhere
          within the correct space on the map to identify it. The space will highlight
          briefly and then the lower left-hand corner will ask you to click on
          the location where you want the space's name to be. A label with the
          name will appear showing the permanent location of the name. Then the
          left-hand corner will ask you to click on the location where you want
          the unit in that space to be. A unit will appear showing the permanent
          location for the unit in that space. It will then ask you to click on
          the next space. Take advantage of the undo feature if you click in the
          wrong space or if you don't like your initial placement of units or
          names.</font>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">When you are done
          with all the spaces, the text box will clear, and you will be able to
          save the Variant.rgn file. Remember to place it in the same variant
          folder with the rest of the files for that variant.</font>

          </font>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#000000" size="2">You
          can modify unit icons to your heart's content. The icons are the standard
          icon file formats used by the respective computer platforms. Windows
          uses files with the .ico extension and Macs use files with icon resources
          contained within. You can edit these icons with the normal icon editing
          tools widely available for each platform. </font>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#000000" size="2">There
          are two ways to modify icons in RealWorld.</font>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#000000" size="2"><i>Global
          icons</i>: Realpolitik comes with a set of icons that is used for any
          variant that does not have specific icons within the variant's folder
          (including the Standard game). On the Mac the global "Icons" file must
          be located in the Realpolitik folder itself. The icons contained this
          file must keep the same resource names as in the original. On the PC
          the global "Icon Files" folder must also be located in the Realpolitik
          folder.</font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> Similarly,
          the files in this folder must keep the same names. </font>
        <p><font color="#000000" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Global
          icons consist of three parts: a color version for each unit type (e.g.
          &quot;RedArmy&quot;, &quot;RedFleet&quot;, &quot;BlueArmy&quot;, etc.),
          a black and white (or patterned) version for each unit (e.g. &quot;RandomArmy&quot;,
          &quot;RandomFleet&quot;, &quot;QuiltArmy&quot;, etc.), and a letter
          that can be stamped on either of the previous two. Realpolitik combines
          these to create the proper icon for a given set of parameters that apply
          to countries differently in different variants. For example, since England
          is blue in Standard the icons will be blue and have the letter "E" stamped
          on them. Since Japan is green in Colonial the icons will be green and
          have the letter "J" stamped on them. The patterned icons are similarly
          used for black and white displays and printers. Considering all the
          possible combinations of colors and letters (not to mention patterns)
          this allows Realpolitik to store a much smaller number of actual icons.
          When combining icon layers to make the final unit icon, Realpolitik
          uses the "color", "pattern" and "initial" information from the Variant.cnt
          file.</font>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#000000" size="2">You
          may edit the supplied global icons. Note that the letter icons are optional,
          so if you wish you may delete them if they don't fit with your new icons
          (however, the Chaos variant may be a little confusing). Of course it's
          always a good idea to work on copies of the icon files until you are
          sure you like the results.</font>
        <p><font color="#000000" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><i>Variant
          specific icons</i>: If you have icons that you want to use only for
          a certain variant, you would place those icon files in the sub-folder
          for that variant. </font>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#000000" size="2">For
          Macs, the file containing the icon resources would be named "Icons".
          The icon resources themselves all have to be named correctly as above:
          "RedArmy", "RedFleet", "BlueArmy", etc. The colors used must correspond
          to the colors defined for the countries in the Variant.cnt file. If
          you wish the icons to appear under black and white enviroments (i.e.
          on a black and white printer, or a grayscale screen), you may want to
          consider making icons for the appropriate patterns as well, however,
          they aren't required.. The letter icons aren't needed unless you wish
          to make a variant with more countries than colors &#151; for example,
          Chaos.</font>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#000000" size="2">For
          PCs all the icon files (one file for each icon) would be contained within
          a folder named "Icon Files". This folder is placed in the sub-folder
          for that variant. The individual icon files should be named "RedArmy.ico",
          "RedFleet.ico", "BlueArmy.ico", etc. Again, the colors and patterns
          (if any) used must correspond to the colors defined for the countries
          in the Variant.cnt file. Letters, as before, are optional.</font>

        <p><font color="#000000" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>Testing
          Your Variant</b> </font>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#000000" size="2">If
          you're lucky your variant is based on a Variant.map file that already
          exists. Otherwise you are faced with the prospect of creating this file
          by hand. As mentioned, not a difficult process (once you understand
          the syntax), but still a tedious one and you are likely to make errors.
          Once you have completed your Variant.map file, you will want to test
          it, but this can be a daunting task considering all the possible moves
          to adjacent spaces for each space on the map. But there is a somewhat
          painless way to test the Variant.map file. It's worth the time spent,
          especially if you did create the file by hand.</font>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#000000" size="2">Once
          your variant is done, start a game in RP. Then use the map edit mode
          to remove all the units of all but one country. Also remove the ownership
          of all the supply centers except the ones owned by the remaining country.
          Then take one army from the remaining country and move it around the
          whole board, one space at a time, testing all the adjacent spaces in
          both directions for each space. Then do the same thing with a fleet.
          You should even make sure that fleets can not move into adjacent land-locked
          spaces nor armies into adjacent sea spaces.</font>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#000000" size="2">Once
          all the home supply centers of the country being "played" are occupied
          with idle units, you won't even have to concern yourself with doing
          builds, so the testing progresses fairly quickly. This could take an
          hour or two, but that's not too bad considering the benefit of finding
          any errors.</font>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#000000" size="2">The
          only thing that does not get checked using this method is unintentional
          distant adjacencies. For example, if the Black Sea were accidentally
          made adjacent to Rome then you won't find such an error. But checking
          all those possible combinations for something that's not likely to happen
          anyway, goes beyond the point of diminishing returns.</font>
