       SourceForge.net (i.e. active developers on a project who are
       listed in the "Project Admins" section of the Summary Page

       are a project administrator, affiliated with a project and
       listed as a project administrator (not just a developer). If
       you are not a project administrator, the information in this
       document likely does not apply to you directly; though you
       do not have the security (as a non-admin) to use the
       instructions provided here, it may be good background

    <p><a href="/">SourceForge.net</a> hosts a large number of Open
    Source software development projects. Each of the projects
    hosted on SourceForge.net has a <a href=
    "/projects/junit/">summary page</a>. The summary page for
    projects is often linked to on project web sites and is often
    listed in the <a href=
    "http://www.freshmeat.net/">Freshmeat.net</a> entries for
    hosted projects. If you have not already found the summary page
    for the pertinent project, please make use of the search
    feature, found in the left navbar of the SourceForge.net
    site.</p>

    <p>Once you reach the summary page for a project, you will
    notice a page section titled "Latest file releases". Make use
    of the "View ALL Project Files" link to display the list of
    available files to download. Locate the file you wish to
    download and make use of the filename link for that file. You
    will note that each file has a basic type description, date
    stamp, and size (so you know how much data you will be
    downloading before you start the download).</p>

    <p>If you wish to review the release notes and change log
    (often included by project administrators so you will have an
    idea of what to expect from a release) for the file release you
    intend to download, simply make use of the link titled with the
    release name. Each file release is listed separately under a
    heading for its associated package. In the event that you
    locate a package which contains no releases, or a release which
    contains no files, please notify the project administrator for
    that project, so as that they may take steps to correct
    this.</p>

    <p>Sample file release page: <a href=
    "/project/showfiles.php?group_id=15278">junit</a></p>

    <p>Release early, release often; the mantra of <a href=
    "http://www.opensource.org/">Open Source software</a>
    developers everywhere. <a href="/">SourceForge.net</a> hosts a
    variety of software development projects, in varying states of
    development and code maturity. It is entirely up to the project
    administrator of each project to decide when it is time to
    first release their software through the file release system,
    and how often subsequent releases should occur. We encourage
    every project to release their code publically early; this
    helps to spark interest in others, as well as to show growth in
    the project.</p>

  <blockquote>
    <p>There are four basic components which play in to the file
    release system. <a href="/">SourceForge.net</a> provides
    hosting for a number of Open Source software development
    projects. Each of these projects has their own space on
    SourceForge.net. File releases on the download servers are
    separated on per project basis. A file release made through the
    admin pages of a project will only show on the download page
    for that project</p>

    <p>This overview will contain a description of how a fictional
    project, "widget", might use the SourceForge.net <a href=
    "#whatisfrs">file release system</a>. Several different
    scenarios will be provided during the course of this overview;
    the way your project decides to use SourceForge.net file
    release system will likely be similar to one of these
    descriptions.</p>

    <p>When a project is working on a particular piece of software,
    that software is often referred to as a package. <a href=
    "http://www.freshmeat.net/">Freshmeat.net</a>, a common source
    for file release news in the Open Source software community, is
    one such place where things are detailed on a per-package
    basis.</p>

    <p>Example: the widget project developers are working on a new
    system for modelling the shapes of plastic boxes for use in a
    CADD/CAM system (which would manufacture these boxes). The
    widget project team is releasing this software under the
    package name "boxmodel". The package name need not differ from
    the UNIX name for your project; most commonly, packages are
    named after the project name (or vice versa). This choice is
    left to the project administrator. Samples:</p>

    <p>Case: Project name differs from package name<br>
    Project name: <a href=
    "/projects/alexandria/">alexandria</a><br>
    Package name: sourceforge</p>

    <p>Case: Project name is the same as the package name<br>
    Project name: <a href="/projects/junit/">junit</a><br>
    Package name: junit</p>

    <p>Within each file release system package will be one or more
    file releases. When a new instance of the package is released,
    a new file release is added within that package in the file
    release system. In our example, the widget project team has
    released version 1.2 of the boxmodel package, thus they have
    created a file release named "1.2" within the boxmodel
    package.</p>

    <p>File releases may be named in a free-form manner on
    SourceForge.net. Open Source software projects often use
    different naming schemes; some projects use numerical releases
    (examples: 1.0, 3.1), some use a more hierarchical numerical
    release scheme (examples: 1.0.2, 2.0.2.3), and some even use
    code names for their releases (examples: Woody, Cartman).
    SourceForge.net permits you to name your releases as you
    desire; simply name your file releases accordingly in the file
    release system.</p>

    <p>The substance of a file release is the file or files
    assigned to that release. Files assigned to a release are shown
    under that release when viewing the download page for a
    project. In order to assign a file to a file release, those
    files must first be uploaded to the incoming directory on
    upload.sourceforge.net. Once the file or files have been
    uploaded, the file release system interface is used to assign
    those files to a particular file release.</p>

    <p>Most commonly, files are named with some bearing on the file
    package and file release they are going to be attached to.
    Within our example, the widget project has just released
    version 1.2 of the boxmodel package. They have built a gzipped
    tarball of sources and have named that file
    boxmodel-1.2.tar.gz. This file is then uploaded per the
    provided instructions, and attached to the "1.2" file release
    of the "boxmodel" package.</p>

    <p>What happens when they release version 1.3 of boxmodel? When
    the new version of boxmodel is released, the widget project
    administrator simply adds the "1.3" file release to the
    "boxmodel" package, uploads the "boxmodel-1.3.tar.gz" source
    archive, and associates that file with the 1.3 release.</p>

    <p>What happens if you want to include binaries as well as
    sources? The widget project administrator has started building
    RPMs for boxmodel. For each new file release, the project
    administrator now uploads three files: the .tar.gz source
    archive, a SRPM, and an i386 RPM. The SourceForge.net system
    permits you to associate multiple files with a single file
    release; files are differentiated by their naming and by the
    file type information added by the project administrator when
    the files are associated with the file release. The same
    process would be used for any other files related to a
    particular file release: binaries for other OS platforms or
    hardware architectures, documentation and manuals which would
    might be provided separately from the source archive as a
    convenience, etc.</p>

    <p>Some projects have both a stable branch and a development or
    unstable branch. This permits end-users to choose between
    stability or the availability of cutting-edge features as they
    see fit. The best way to accommodate such a scheme under the
    SourceForge.net file release system is to have a separate
    package for the development releases from that used for the
    stable releases. To extend our example, the widget project
    decides to provide a separate development tree for their
    boxmodel code base. To facilitate this change, they create a
    new package named "boxmodel-devel". File releases under the
    development tree may then be added to the "boxmodel-devel"
    package and they may continue to post stable releases under the
    "boxmodel" package.</p>

    <p>There may be cases where a project would need to include
    several different component packages for each release. Often
    times, these components are dependent on a base package, but
    are optional from the end-user perspective. A perfectly good
    solution is to include each of these components as a separate
    file within a particular file release.</p>

    <p>What if our project releases multiple, very different,
    pieces of software? The way to deal with this case may differ
    from project to project. One way of dealing with this case
    would be to simply add another package for each of the major
    pieces of software the project provides. When the software has
    matured to the point where it generally is managed and
    developed by two separate development teams, the administrator
    for that project may decide to register a new, separate project
    to more cleanly separate the different package offerings.
    Generally speaking, adding a new package will usually
    suffice.</p>

    <p>How can I convey information about file release changes or
    release notes to my end-users? When a file release is created,
    the administrator may elect to provide release notes and/or a
    change log for that release. A link to this information is
    displayed along side the download link for that release on the
    download page for the project. Release notes and change log
    information may, of course, also be included within the files
    included in the release.</p>

    <p>This concludes our overview of the SourceForge.net file
    release system and its components. In summary, each software
    effort should have a project; each project should release one
    or more packages (the fewer packages, the better, generally);
    each package will contain one or more file release (and this
    number will increase as the project makes more software
    releases; and each file release will contain one or more file.
    To keep your administrative overhead low: keep things simple,
    allocate only what you need.</p>

  <blockquote>
    <p>In the event that you should upload the wrong file to the
    incoming directory on upload.sourceforge.net, you will probably
    be looking for a way to remove that file. It is important to
    realize that access to files in the incoming directory is
    restricted; in order for a file to be accessed remotely, it
    would need to be associated with a file release.</p>

    <p>There are two solutions available for removing content from
    the incoming directory. First, the incoming directory is
    automatically purged every 24 hours (only materials which are
    more than 24 hours old and have not been attached to a file
    release are purged). If you cannot wait, you have the second
    option of attaching the bad upload to your file release, then
    deleting the file from the file release; it is important that
    you not do this on files you intend to overwrite (i.e. that you
    intend to replace with a file of the same file name).</p>

  <blockquote>
    <p>The obvious answer: sources. As stated, SourceForge.net does
    not make any demands as to how often project administrators
    perform releases. When a project does decide to make a file
    release, the obvious course of action is to generate a .zip
    archive or .tar.gz (compressed tarball) of their sources.</p>

    <p>Be sure to include a copy of your license information within
    your source archive. Most projects include at least a basic
    README describing the purpose of the software and include links
    within that document for places their end-users may get support
    for the software. Build your source archive; check its
    contents, the permissions on files and directories, and the
    directory layout within the archive. It is always easier to
    check the archive before a lengthy upload.</p>

    <p>Many projects have test teams which will verify the basic
    functionality of release archives before those releases occur.
    If your project has grown to have a significant user base, this
    is definitely something you should consider.</p>

    <p>If you are providing binary archives through the file
    release system, please ensure that the sources for those
    binaries are also available, as required by the license
    governing that software. Generally, it is also a good idea to
    include some form of change log (descriptions of functional
    differences between releases) and release notes within your
    release archives. The more suitable the documentation you
    provide within your release, the less likely your end-users
    will require your support.</p>

    <p>In short, no. One of the major benefits of Open Source
    development comes in retaining historical file releases for
    your project. Old releases can be an important debugging tool.
    Old releases can help show the development efforts of your
    team. Other people may have reasons to run older releases,
    depending on file format changes or resource requirements. Code
    included in old releases, while having been discarded for newer
    releases, may prove useful for other projects. SourceForge.net
    has the space to store a large amount of release data in the

  <blockquote>
    <p>As a project administrator, you are likely looking to make
    your project operations as streamlined as possible, cut down on
    the amount of time your team spends dealing with issues, and
    keep things as simple as possible (the KISS principle). Based
    on our experience in hosting projects on SourceForge.net, we
    offer a few tips, as related to your file releases:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>If your project uses a CVS repository, it is generally a
      good idea to match the module names for different major
      components to the file release package names for those same
      components (if those components are split in to separate
      packages at time of release). This makes locating specific
      materials in your CVS repository considerably easier for
      potential developers, and helps to keep things straight with
      existing developers.</li>

      <li>Keep in mind that a single project shares the same CVS
      repository, bug tracker, support request tracker, forums, and
      mailing lists no matter how many packages are released by
      that project. If a single project releases a large number of
      very different packages, managing the other aspects of the
      project can become more difficult. It is often better to
      register separate projects for each major subject a team
      chooses to undertake, rather than adding clutter to a single
      project.</li>

      <li>If you want users to ask for support in a certain manner,
      document that fact. Include this type of documentation in
      your file releases, on your project web site, and in the
      release notes for your file releases. The more concentrated
      your support effort, the less overhead is involved in
      providing support.</li>

      <li>If your project releases several different packages,
      consider adding a Tracker category for each package. This
      permits you to separate issues easily by package and ensure
      those issues reach the appropriate developer or support staff
      in a timely manner.</li>

      <li>Similar may be said of forums and mailing lists. It is
      our recommendation, however, that you start with a generic
      forum or mailing list for users, and similar for developers;
      if volume warrants, then consider splitting out a separate
      forum or mailing list for each package.</li>

      <li>Release materials from your project in a consistent
      manner. Include the same basic directory structure with each
      of your releases. Most Open Source software development
      projects include all contents under a directory with the same
      name as the file (i.e. if we are releasing
      boxmodel-1.0.tar.gz, all contents within that archive would
      be under a directory structure named boxmodel-1.0). Include
      consistent documentation within each release. Consistency
      helps avoid confusion (if you use a reasonable release
      structure to begin with).</li>
    </ul>

  <blockquote>
    <p>The SourceForge.net system does not currently provide the
    means to perform file releases using SCP or SFTP. Only
    anonymous FTP is supported at this time. It is our expectation
    that file releases do not contain proprietary or secret
    information (they are, after all, going on to a
    publically-accessible download server). If you are concerned
    about security, perform your file release, then re-download
    your files from the server to verify their integrity.</p>

    <p>You may also choose to include GNU Privacy Guard or PGP
    signatures for your file releases (simply include them as files
    within your file release). If you do have concerns about
    end-to-end file security, you may first upload your files to
    the group directory for your project on the project shell
    servers, then perform the file release from there.</p>
